      <p class="sb-section-1">At the most basic level, everything is made up of frequency. Our bodies are actually mostly empty space. We are electromagnetic beings and we are greatly affected by the myriad of frequencies that surround us. Emotions, thoughts, microwaves, electromagnetic frequencies (EMFS), sound, plants, you, and me; we all carry a specific frequency. These can be beneficial, neutral, or harmful to biological life.</p>
    </div>
    <br><br>
    <div class="fade-paragraph">
      <p class="sb-section-1">Emotions, thoughts, and beliefs can literally keep us in a holding pattern or elevate us to our wildest dreams. Past events that have not been fully processed can also keep us in a loop of experiences. A nervous system that is constantly in fight or flight greatly taxes the body and skews ones perception of reality. What you emit is what you attract. So much of this is on the subconscious level.</p>

      <p class="sb-section-1">Thankfully, there are vast amounts of tools to help get the energy in motion (e-motions right?). One incredibly beneficial way is through Sound Baths. After 15 years of deep devotion to my craft, I have developed a profound combination of methods to help the process. There are several layers that combine to make the experience a great source of recalibration and healing. No matter if you are looking for relaxation, meditation, release, repatterning, nervous system regulation, etc. the experience will serve what you seek.</p>

    <br><br>
    <div class="fade-paragraph">
      <p class="sb-section-1">I am not claiming some miracle fix, more so a way to help move the needle. Yet, it is a profound tool that I have had beautiful feedback about from my attendees. I also offer private 1:1 sessions where we can go really deep. The experience is entirely focused on the clients unique needs and goals. These are a whole other level. Let’s go into some of the layers I referred to.</p>
    </div>
    <br><br>
    <div class="fade-paragraph">
      <p class="sb-section-1">Each instrument serves a different purpose.They all have a specific effect on either the psyche, brain waves, organs, body as a whole, or magnetic field. If you are interested in learning more about this in depth, I teach classes about my methods. The more sound bath facilitators out there, the better, in my opinion. I also utilize my training in energy healing to further help clear blockages, balance over or under active energy centers, address the root of pain, etc. I sing sacred medicine songs that I have been working with for many years that all have their own purposes and frequency that work on different aspects of the spirit, body, emotions, or mind. The longer you work with a sacred song, you build a relationship with it. It becomes more etched in your spirit and the energetic quality builds in potency. Last but certainly not least, I incorporate two frequency devices. Both emit a unique set of frequencies for the group or individual. One via scalar waves (micro-current can also be utilized for 1:1 clients)  and the other through a Pulsed Electromagnetic Field (PEMF). You can learn more about these devices by going to the menu and clicking (or does saying ‘selecting’ sound better?) “healy”.</p>

      <p class="sb-section-1">I offer group sound baths at different businesses, festivals, retreats, and in private 1:1 sessions. You can find my upcoming <a href="#">public offerings below</a>. You can also <a href="#">book a call</a> to talk about and schedule a private 1:1 session or to have me at a private or public event.
