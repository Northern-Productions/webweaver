    <h2>Why Web Weaver?</h2>
  
    <p>
      I am on a mission to help repair the web of life, community, and connection.
      <br><br>
      Above all else, people need to have a sense of belonging. Most of us have been severed from our connection to nature,
      <br><br>
      natural cycles, ourselves, or authentic relating. From our ancestors and rites of passage.
      <br><br>
      Through my offerings, writing, classes, and gatherings I have created many threads for you to dive into. We all bring our own unique medicine, and we need each of us to clear our lense of perception so we can truly thrive. Because only together can we do our part to birth the world we know is possible.
      <br><br>
      Can you hear the calling of the Earth?
      <br><br>
      Urging us to align with our authentic truth. To rise into service to each other, and to the Earth. We are at an important juncture. Let's continue to get creative with how to move the needle towards balance. To co-create and even the playing field by collaboration over competition.
      <br><br>
      Emulate nature's symbiosis. Remember abundance is our birthright and generational wealth is meant for all.
      <br><br>
      Since Web Weaver is inspired by both mushroom/mycelium and spider wisdom, I am all about alchemizing, breaking down what does not serve into fertile soil to intentionally build with. As well as weaving an ever wider web of connection.
      <br><br>
      I would love to see where our threads of connection take us. Explore my little sacred space here. Peek into my offerings, musings, and ways we can weave together. I am glad you found your way here.
      <br><br>
      Welcome friend.</p>
