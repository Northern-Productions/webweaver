    <h2 class="title-md">Why Web Weaver?</h2>
  
    <p class="section-1-content">
      I am on a mission to help repair the web of life, community, and connection.
      <br><br>
      Above all else, people need to have a sense of belonging. Most of us have been severed from our connection to nature,
      <br><br>
      natural cycles, ourselves, or authentic relating. From our ancestors and rites of passage.
      <br><br>
      Through my offerings, writing, classes, and gatherings I have created many threads for you to dive into. We all bring our own unique medicine, and we need each of us to clear our lense of perception so we can truly thrive. Because only together can we do our part to birth the world we know is possible.
      <br><br>
      Can you hear the calling of the Earth?
      <br><br>
      Urging us to align with our authentic truth. To rise into service to each other, and to the Earth. We are at an important juncture. Let's continue to get creative with how to move the needle towards balance. To co-create and even the playing field by collaboration over competition.
      <br><br>
      Emulate nature's symbiosis. Remember abundance is our birthright and generational wealth is meant for all.
      <br><br>
      Since Web Weaver is inspired by both mushroom/mycelium and spider wisdom, I am all about alchemizing, breaking down what does not serve into fertile soil to intentionally build with. As well as weaving an ever wider web of connection.
      <br><br>
      I would love to see where our threads of connection take us. Explore my little sacred space here. Peek into my offerings, musings, and ways we can weave together. I am glad you found your way here.
      <br><br>
      Welcome friend.</p>

        <img src="./images/language alchemy.png" alt="A table with an large assortment of items">
        <p>A transformational group container to discover and transform our relationship with language. Seeing the words, spells, we cast help to look into the well of our emotions, relation to self, possible shadow aspects, false beliefs and more. Part mentoring, part course, part ceremony. We will also have a telegram group for continual conversation throughout the container, guided meditations, journal prompts, and voice notes with extra nuggets. Learn more about this container and when it opens here.</p>

        <h3>Frequency & The Water Body Classes</h3>
        <img src="./images/frequency & waterbody class.png" alt="Water dropping into water making ripples">
        <p>Frequency is the foundation of all matter, and water is the foundation of all life. At different locations in the NW Suburbs of Chicago, festivals, and wellness gatherings I dive deep in both of these vast subjects, and then weave together how they interact with and amplify each other. See the itinerary of what I cover and how to book me at your space or event here.</p>
