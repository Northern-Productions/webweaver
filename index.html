    <h2 class="title-md">Why Web Weaver?</h2>

    <div class="spacer"></div>
  
    <p class="section-1-content">
      I am on a <span class="bold blue">mission</span> to help repair the web of <i class="bold blue">life, community,</i> and <i class="bold blue">connection</i>.
      <br><br>
      Above all else, people need to have a sense of <span class="bold blue">belonging</span>. Most of us have been severed from our connection to nature, natural cycles, ourselves, or authentic relating. From our ancestors and rites of passage.
      <br><br>
      Through my offerings, writing, classes, and gatherings I have created many threads for you to dive into. We all bring our own unique medicine, and we need each of us to clear our lens of perception so we can truly <i class="bold blue">thrive</i>. Because only together can we do our part to birth the world we know is possible.
      <br><br>
      Can you hear the calling of the Earth?
      <br><br>
      Urging us to align with our <span class="bold blue">authentic truth</span>. To rise into service to each other, and to the Earth. We are at an important juncture. Let's continue to get creative with how to move the needle towards <i class="bold blue">balance</i>. To co-create and even the playing field by collaboration over competition.
      <br><br>
      Emulate nature's symbiosis. Remember abundance is our <span class="bold blue">birthright</span> and generational wealth is meant for all. Give back to to the web of life and the great mystery.
      <br><br>
      Since Web Weaver is inspired by both mushroom and spider wisdom, I am all about <i class="bold blue">alchemizing</i> and breaking down what does not serve into fertile soil to intentionally build with. As well as weaving an ever wider web of connection.
      <br><br>
      I would love to see where our threads of <span class="bold blue">connection</span> take us. Explore my sacred space here. Peek into my offerings, musings, and ways we can weave together. I am glad you found your way here.
      <br><br>
      Welcome friend

        <p>A transformational group container to discover and transform our relationship with language.

        <h3>Frequency & The Water Body Classes</h3>
        <img src="./images/frequency & waterbody class.png" alt="Water dropping into water making ripples">
        <p>Frequency is the foundation of all matter, and water is the foundation of all life. At different locations in the NW Suburbs of Chicago, festivals, and wellness gatherings I dive deep in both of these vast subjects, and then weave together how they interact with and amplify each other. See the itinerary of what I cover and how to book me at your space or event here.</p>

        <p>My name is Emily Mayberry. I offer transformative containers and mentoring. Weaving sound and frequency in sound baths and 1 on 1 ceremonies is a deep calling as well. Here to be a part of the movement to birth a new-old way of being. To reclaim the sacred with authenticity.</p>

        Water is the foundation of all life, it is a sacred record keeper, it is intelligent. I work closely with the waters. I am a water ceremony carrier from the Anishinaabe Ojibwe lineage. Water is one of my greatest teachers and friends. While I love diving into the spiritual & mystic sides of water, I equally am a student of the scientific lens, as with most things I am drawn to. Two sides of the same coin, each deepening the understanding of the other. I hope to sit in circle with you if you feel the waters calling. To weave prayers for the water, or to let me share the depths I am continually adding to. To learn from you as well. We all have our own wellspring of knowledge, and we are here to weave it all together. Bless the waters, may they always be protected, respected, and run clean.

      <div class="section-4-content">
        <p>We are in a time of great <span class="bold blue">change</span> and <span class="bold blue">remembering</span>. As we reclaim so much of what has been lost, a deep healing is needed, as well as forgiving. A consciousness has been moving through the collective causing the <i class="bold blue">deepest shadows</i> to emerge.
        <br><br>
        I truly believe everything serves a purpose. But we cannot move forward without witnessing, then releasing all that has transpired. Are you ready to <span class="bold blue">reclaim your truth</span>? Our birth right? Be a part of the regeneration?  I am ready to walk that path <i class="bold blue">alongside</i> you.
        <br><br>
        A new <span class="bold blue">frequency</span> is rising, just in time. We live in a time of prophecy. I am in service to this, and to anyone who is in need of support, or community. All of what I do and offer revolves around this <i class="bold blue">living prayer</i>.
