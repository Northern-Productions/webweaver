    <p class="section-1-content">
      I am on a mission to help repair the web of life, community, and connection.
      <br><br>
      Above all else, people need to have a sense of belonging. Most of us have been severed from our connection to nature, natural cycles, ourselves, or authentic relating. From our ancestors and rites of passage.
      <br><br>
      Through my offerings, writing, classes, and gatherings I have created many threads for you to dive into. We all bring our own unique medicine, and we need each of us to clear our lens of perception so we can truly thrive. Because only together can we do our part to birth the world we know is possible.
      <br><br>
      Can you hear the calling of the Earth?
      <br><br>
      Urging us to align with our authentic truth. To rise into service to each other, and to the Earth. We are at an important juncture. Let's continue to get creative with how to move the needle towards balance. To co-create and even the playing field by collaboration over competition.
      <br><br>
      Emulate nature's symbiosis. Remember abundance is our birthright and generational wealth is meant for all. Give back to to the web of life and the great mystery.
      <br><br>
      Since Web Weaver is inspired by both mushroom and spider wisdom, I am all about alchemizing and breaking down what does not serve into fertile soil to intentionally build with. As well as weaving an ever wider web of connection.
      <br><br>
      I would love to see where our threads of connection take us. Explore my sacred space here. Peek into my offerings, musings, and ways we can weave together. I am glad you found your way here.
      <br><br>
      Welcome friend

        <img src="./images/frequency & waterbody class.png" alt="Water dropping into water making ripples">
        <p>Frequency is the foundation of all matter, and water is the foundation of all life. At different locations in the NW Suburbs of Chicago, festivals, and wellness gatherings I dive deep in both of these vast subjects, and then weave together how they interact with and amplify each other. See the itinerary of what I cover and how to book me at your space or event here.</p>

        <p>My name is Emily Mayberry. I offer transformative containers and mentoring. Weaving sound and frequency in sound baths and 1 on 1 ceremonies is a deep calling as well. Here to be a part of the movement to birth a new-old way of being. To reclaim the sacred with authenticity.</p>

    <div class="section-4">
      <p>We are in a time of great change and remembering. As we reclaim so much of what has been lost, a deep healing is needed, as well as forgiving. A consciousness has been moving through the collective causing the deepest shadows to emerge.
      <br><br><br>
      I truly believe everything serves a purpose. But we cannot move forward without witnessing, then releasing all that has transpired. Are you ready to reclaim your truth? Our birth right? Be a part of the regeneration?  I am ready to walk that path alongside you.
      <br><br><br>
      A new frequency is rising, just in time. We live in a time of prophecy. I am in service to this, and to anyone who is in need of support, or community. All of what I do and offer revolves around this living prayer.
